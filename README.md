Cognitive Medical Assistant Application.

#Framework

This application contains an custom framework for hybrid application to be executed in Android Platform. I am assuming the UI and business logic of the application would be developed using HTML5 and javascript. I have exposed few utility methods for accessing native features of the phone. 
The aim of this framework is to quickly build a hybrid application just by updating the html and js files available under www directory.

## Current native api exposed as javascript 
1. Get Device Id
2. Save & retrieval data in a local file store in form of JSON. 
3. Usage of spalsh screen is in build. Someone need to change the logo and texts 
4. Dispalying alerts as native Toasts

## TODO: 
1. Prepare a detailed step by step process to customization ( Changing the logo, splash texts)
2. Adding more native features. ( GeoLocation, Camera, Contacts etc)
